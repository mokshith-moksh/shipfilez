          The only information we keep is a record of the total number of daily
          users and some basic statistics regarding file transfers. This data
          helps us monitor system performance and identify any issues quickly.

          For example, we can track the total number of successful and failed
          transfers, as well as how often fallback methods are utilized. This
          enables us to address bugs and improve the platform effectively.
